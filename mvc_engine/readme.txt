A matlab MVC (model-view-controller) representation of a GUI for reading xml files, running dll files and for visualization of thermodynamic property packages. 

To run the GUI- set path in folder root and execute runApplication.m
The view module is based on matlab's (not so powerful) GUI capabilities


The system was made for quick insight into thermo-package from CO2SIM specific properties from a simple GUI. For more detailed information, see CO2SIM. 
The dll-engine as well as property specific files are taken out.
